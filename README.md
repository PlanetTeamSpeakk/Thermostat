# Thermostat

A simple thermostat app built in Rust using [Slint](https://slint.dev).  
Manages the temperature in my room using an electric heater (and a backend Node.js server and Python script).  
Uses a backend server which actually controls the heater: [Thermostat API](https://github.com/PlanetTeamSpeakk/Thermostat-API).
